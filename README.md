# Vapor-Pressure-Calculations
A program that can predict: 
(a) Ethanol vapor pressure vs. temperature 
(b) Ethanol vapor pressure vs. molar volume ethanol 
(c) The heat of vaporization vs. temperature

This program uses the Peng-Robinson equation of state.
Source used to assist in writing the program: Peng, D.Y. and Robinson, D.B., 1976. A new two-constant equation of state. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Fundamentals, 15(1), pp.59-64.

Approach used for root solving: Newton-Raphson
